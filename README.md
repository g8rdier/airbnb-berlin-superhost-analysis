## Data Cleaning Pipelines

This project employs **dual data cleaning approaches** tailored to specific analytical requirements:

### **Strict Cleaning Pipeline** (`02_data_cleaning.R`)
- **Purpose:** Descriptive statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- **Approach:** Conservative outlier removal and rigorous data quality filtering
- **Dataset:** 8,783 listings after exclusions
- **Rationale:** Ensures statistical robustness for inferential analyses by removing extreme values and incomplete records
- **Use Cases:** t-tests, quantile regression, interaction effects analysis

### **Relaxed Cleaning Pipeline** (`02b_relaxed_data_cleaning.R`)
- **Purpose:** Predictive modeling and machine learning applications
- **Approach:** Minimal filtering with outlier retention for training diversity
- **Dataset:** Larger sample size with broader value ranges preserved
- **Rationale:** Maintains data variability essential for model generalization and real-world prediction accuracy
- **Use Cases:** Linear regression, price prediction models, cross-validation

### **Key Differences**
| **Aspect** | **Strict Pipeline** | **Relaxed Pipeline** |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Outlier Treatment** | Remove extreme values | Retain for training diversity |
| **Missing Data** | Stringent exclusion | Imputation strategies |
| **Sample Size** | Optimized for inference | Maximized for learning |
| **Primary Goal** | Statistical significance | Predictive performance |
