# Berlin Airbnb Superhost Pricing Differentiation: Multi-methodological Statistical Analysis

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of Superhost pricing differentiation strategies in Berlin's Airbnb market using a multi-methodological approach. The research combines Welch's t-tests, quantile regression (τ = 0.25/0.5/0.75/0.9), tertile-based market segmentation, and linear regression models with 70/30 train-test validation to reveal sophisticated pricing strategies and demonstrate practical applicability.
